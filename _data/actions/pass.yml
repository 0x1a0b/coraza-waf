name: pass
description: |
  Continues processing with the next rule in spite of a successful match.
version: 0.1
actiongroup: Disruptive
example: |
  SecRule REQUEST_HEADERS:User-Agent "Test" "log,pass,id:122"
data: |
  When using pass with a SecRule with multiple targets, all variables will be inspected and all non-disruptive actions trigger for every match. In the following example, the TX.test variable will be incremented once for every request parameter:
  ```
  # Set TX.test to zero 
  SecAction "phase:2,nolog,pass,setvar:TX.test=0,id:123"

  # Increment TX.test for every request parameter 
  SecRule ARGS "test" "phase:2,log,pass,setvar:TX.test=+1,id:124"
  ```

  Severity values in ModSecurity follows the numeric scale of syslog (where 0 is the most severe). The data below is used by the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS):

  - **0 - EMERGENCY**: is generated from correlation of anomaly scoring data where there is an inbound attack and an outbound leakage.
  - **1 - ALERT**: is generated from correlation where there is an inbound attack and an outbound application level error.
  - **2 - CRITICAL**: Anomaly Score of 5. Is the highest severity level possible without correlation. It is normally generated by the web attack rules (40 level files).
  - **3 - ERROR**: Error - Anomaly Score of 4. Is generated mostly from outbound leakage rules (50 level files).
  - **4 - WARNING**: Anomaly Score of 3. Is generated by malicious client rules (35 level files).
  - **5 - NOTICE**: Anomaly Score of 2. Is generated by the Protocol policy and anomaly files.
  - **6 - INFO**
  - **7 - DEBUG**
  It is possible to specify severity levels using either the numerical values or the text values, but you should always specify severity levels using the text values, because it is difficult to remember what a number stands for.

name: skip
description: |
  Skips one or more rules (or chains) on successful match.
version: 0.1
actiongroup: Flow
example: |
  # Require Accept header, but not from access from the localhost 
  SecRule REMOTE_ADDR "^127\.0\.0\.1$" "phase:1,skip:1,id:141" 

  # This rule will be skipped over when REMOTE_ADDR is 127.0.0.1 
  SecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:Accept "@eq 0" "phase:1,id:142,deny,msg:'Request Missing an Accept Header'"
data: |
  The skip action works only within the current processing phase and not necessarily in the order in which the rules appear in the configuration file. If you place a phase 2 rule after a phase 1 rule that uses skip, it will not skip over the phase 2 rule. It will skip over the next phase 1 rule that follows it in the phase.

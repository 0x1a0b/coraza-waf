  This directive must be provided before initcol, setsid, and setuid can be used. The directory to which the directive points must be writable by the web server user.

  **Note:** This directive is not allowed inside VirtualHosts. If enabled, it must be placed in a global server-wide configuration file such as your default modsecurity.conf.
  
  **Note:** SecDataDir is not currently supported. Collections are kept in memory (in_memory-per_process) for now.

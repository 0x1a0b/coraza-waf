description: |
  Set the default persistence engine for persistent collections, currently supports redis and inmemory databases.

  Inmemory database is meant for testing, not for production.

  More engines are going to be added in the near future.

  Redis URI structure: ``redis://[[username :] password@] host [: port] [/ database][? [timeout=timeout[d|h|m|s|ms|us|ns]] [&_database=database_]]``
  ```
  SecPersistenceEngine redis://127.0.0.1
  SecPersistenceEngine inmemory
  ```

  **Important:** Inmemory engine is storing everything in memory and it can be overwhelming.
